This TicTacToe game stores every game played to a text file called "GameFiles". These games are stored with the first 9 characters representing the position and order of moves played, and the last two communicating if a win/loss ("nn") or a tie ("TT") has occured. The computer uses these past games to always find the most optimal next move to play. After enough unique games, the computer will never lose.
